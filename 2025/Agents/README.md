# LLM Agent Tutorial

## Getting Started

* Start by going to the [vLLM](./vllm) directory and starting your vLLM server.
* The exercises are best-conducted on your local machine. So once the server is started, switch to working locally.
* Install the `uv` package manager by running `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`. 
* Make sure to add the path to your PATH variable in `~/.bashrc` and then `source ~/.bashrc`.
